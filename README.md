## Play

The game runs as soon as the page loads and the timer starts counting, so start moving fast! The enemies are already in motion. The girl is placed at the starting point. To move around the squares, use the arrow keys. Your goal is to arrive to the last row of squares before the water. When a bug hits you, you lose a life (heart). If you lose 3 lives, the game is over. If you reach the water 10 times, you win and you have 100 points!


## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
